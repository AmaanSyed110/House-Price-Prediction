## Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as area type, availability, location, size, society, total square feet, number of bathrooms, and the presence of a balcony. By analyzing these attributes, the model aims to capture the underlying patterns and relationships that influence housing prices. The accurate prediction of house prices can be beneficial for homebuyers, real estate agents, and property developers in making informed decisions and pricing strategies.
